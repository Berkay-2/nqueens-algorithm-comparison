# Comparative Analysis of Search and Optimization Algorithms for the N-Queens Problem

This repository contains Python implementations and experimental results for my MSc Pattern Recognition project at the **University of Europe for Applied Sciences (Berlin)**.

## 🧩 Algorithms Implemented
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Hill Climbing
- Simulated Annealing
- Genetic Algorithm

Each algorithm was tested on N = 10, 30, 50, 100, and 200 queens, measuring runtime, scalability, and success rate.

## 📊 Project Overview
The project compares **classical search** and **metaheuristic optimization** techniques for solving the N-Queens problem.
Results demonstrate that **Simulated Annealing** achieves the best scalability and reliability across larger N values.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.11
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- macOS M2 environment (8 GB RAM)
